# Environmental AI Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on environmental applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Developed as part of coursework at **Esprit-School-of-Engineering**, these notebooks explore various techniques for waste management, recycling identification, and environmental text analysis.

## Features
- **Battery Detection & Classification**: Computer vision model for identifying battery types in waste streams
- **Waste Detection System**: Object detection for various waste categories using YOLOv8
- **Environmental Text Analysis**: NER model for highlighting and extracting environmental concepts from text
- **XAI for Object Detection**: Explainable AI techniques applied to YOLO waste detection models
- **Lifecycle Diffusion Models**: Generative models for environmental applications

## Tech Stack
### Machine Learning
- **Ultralytics**: For YOLO implementation and training
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face libraries for NLP tasks
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks
- **Roboflow**: For dataset management and augmentation

### Data Processing
- **NumPy/Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
